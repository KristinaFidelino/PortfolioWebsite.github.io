                <p> The To Do List application is a simple and very essential to use. It will help you organize your schedules and workloads, set reminders, set important notes,  keep on track of important projects, and lastly is to create a to do list. In the very first page of our To Do List Application, we can see a feature of LogIn. I put this kind of features for the security and privacy of the owner and some of the people that might involve. The <b>"About To Do List"</b> page contains a basic information about the to do list application. It also introduce how the application can help the users in terms of completing their task and other things that they need to do. The <b>"Go to Do list"</b> page is where it welcomes the user in the application. The <b>"About the Creator"</b> page will be display wherein it introduce about the creator of the to do list applications.In the <b>"To do List"</b> page is where we can add a note or list for the things that the users need to do. By clicking the plus button for us to be able to add a list. It also have a <b>"Log Out"</b> button. By clicking this we are able to log out in our application. In <b>"To do Application"</b> the username and the password will not be displayed. This is for the security and privacy of the owner. 
                </p>  
                    
                    
                <p>    The features that I am still working for the application to be more convenient and easy to use are adding a calendars. By using the calendar they can set an appointment with someone, setting a reminders and make a schedules. I am also thinking to improve the Interface of my applications. I also want to add a Task track wherein they can check how many task or things are left to be finished. 
                </p>  
                    
                    
                    
                <p> In creating this task, will help everyone not just by keeping track on the things that they need to do but also help their mental and emotional health. Using this kind of application will lessen the anxiety, stress, panicked and over thinking.
